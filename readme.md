## Issue

We're using [@vercel/ncc](https://github.com/vercel/ncc) bundler to create (almost) a single JS file to avoid polluting the CLI user node_modules.

From ink 4.x, ncc does build but, once run with node, exists with an [(13) Unfinished Top-Level Await](https://nodejs.org/api/process.html#exit-codes) error.
